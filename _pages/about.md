## Meet Dr. Dorothy “Dot” MacDonald

Hi! I’m Dorothy MacDonald — but you can call me **Dr. Dot**.

I’m a Ph.D.-qualified scientist, educator, and passionate advocate for student growth. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve
taught in some of the UK’s top schools and colleges, supporting students aged 10 to 18+ in mastering Biology, Human
Health, Chemistry, and more.

I love helping learners feel confident and capable — even when they thought science wasn’t “their thing.”


## Why I Teach Online

I founded my online tutoring service to bring **personalized science education** to students around the globe.

Whether you're preparing for IB, SQA, A-Level exams, or just need a bit of help cracking mitosis, I’ll meet you with a
smile, a strategy, and a clear explanation.

## Credentials

- **Ph.D. in Immunology**
- **BSc (Hons) in Physiology**, First Class
- **PGDE** in Biology with General Science
- **SQA Marker** and **IB Internal Assessment Supervisor**
- Former Assistant Year Head, CAS mentor, and UCAS coach

## A Few Fun Facts

- I love science clubs, Duke of Edinburgh hikes, and nutrition challenges.
- I bake a mean brownie and tell terrible science jokes.
- My favourite cell organelle is... yes, the mitochondrion.

Let’s work together to build your confidence and get results — with curiosity and kindness at the heart.
