## 👩‍🔬 Meet Dr. Dorothy “Dot” MacDonald

Hi! I’m Dorothy MacDonald — but you can call me **Dr. Dot**.

I’m a Ph.D.-qualified scientist, educator, and passionate advocate for student growth. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve taught in some of the UK’s top schools and colleges, supporting students aged 10 to 18+ in mastering Biology, Human Health, Chemistry, and more.

I love helping learners feel confident and capable — even when they thought science wasn’t “their thing.”
