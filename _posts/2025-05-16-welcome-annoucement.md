Starting something new always brings a mix of excitement and butterflies — and today, I'm delighted to share a personal
milestone: **launching my own online science tutoring practice**.

For over 17 years, I’ve been teaching science in classrooms full of curious young minds. From whiteboards filled with cell diagrams to late-night exam revision sessions, I’ve seen how science can spark wonder, confusion, ambition, and joy — often all at once.

Now, I'm bringing that same energy and experience to students **wherever they are in the world**. No school bell, no borders — just personalised science learning built around the student.

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This

In truth, I’ve been thinking about this for years. I love teaching — not just the subject, but the people. Helping a student ‘click’ with a difficult topic, or watching someone go from “I can’t do this” to “I’ve got this!” — that’s the magic.

Going online means I can offer flexible, one-to-one support for students preparing for exams, catching up after illness, or just needing someone to explain photosynthesis in a way that finally makes sense.

## 🧬 What I Believe

Science is not just a subject — it’s a way of thinking. I want students to:
{: .text-justify}
* Ask good questions
* Be unafraid of getting it wrong
* Learn with curiosity, not just for the test

And I believe everyone — truly everyone — can get better at science with the right support.

## 💌 What Comes Next

This site is where you’ll find updates, study tips, and stories from the tutoring journey. I’ll share resources, answer questions, and hopefully help a few more students discover that science isn’t just something to survive — it’s something to love.

Thanks for being here at the start.
