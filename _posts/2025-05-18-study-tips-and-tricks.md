Studying science doesn’t have to feel like decoding a foreign language. With the right strategies, anyone can build
confidence, improve memory, and actually enjoy the learning process.

Here are some of my favourite study tips and tricks that I share with students — whether you’re revising for GCSEs,
Higher Biology, or prepping for IB SEHS.

## 🧠 1. Study in Short, Active Bursts

Forget marathon cramming. Use the **Pomodoro Technique**:

* 25 minutes of focused work
* 5-minute break
* Repeat 3–4 times, then take a longer break

This keeps your brain fresh and helps you stay focused without burning out.


## ✍️ 2. Use Retrieval Practice

Instead of rereading notes, try **recalling information** without looking. Quiz yourself with flashcards, teach the
content to someone else, or sketch a diagram from memory. This strengthens long-term recall much more than passive
review.


## 🔄 3. Interleave Topics

Mix up what you revise. For example:

* 10 minutes on enzymes
* 10 minutes on the respiratory system
* 10 minutes on genetic inheritance

Your brain learns better when it’s forced to switch gears.


## 🖼️ 4. Use Visuals and Colour

Mind maps, flow charts, labelled diagrams — these help you *see* connections and simplify complex systems. Don’t be
afraid to add colour for organisation and memory cues.


## 📚 5. Practice Past Papers

This is the gold standard for exam success. Familiarise yourself with the format, style, and language used by exam
boards. Bonus tip: mark your answers using the official mark scheme.


## 💤 6. Sleep & Spacing

It’s not just what you study, but **when**. Spread revision over several days. Sleep helps consolidate new information —
so pulling all-nighters isn’t just painful, it’s ineffective.


## 💬 Need Help?

These strategies are even more effective when paired with expert support. If you’d like tailored help with Biology,
Human Biology, or SEHS, feel free to [get in touch](/contact/). Let’s make studying feel doable (and maybe even fun!).
